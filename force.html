        <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">Applied Force
          
        </h1>
        
        

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            An applied force is a force that is applied to an object by a person or another object.
             If a person is pushing a desk across the room, then there is an applied force acting upon the object. 
             The applied force is the force exerted on the desk by the person.
            </p>


        <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">Gravity Force
          
        </h1>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            The force of gravity is the force with which the earth, moon, or other massively large object attracts 
            another object towards itself. By definition, this is the weight of the object. All objects upon earth experience a force of gravity
             that is directed "downward" towards the center of the earth. The force of gravity on earth is always equal to the weight of the object
              as found by the equation:  W = m * g
            </p>
        
        <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">Normal Force</h1>

          <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
              The normal force is the support force exerted upon an object that is in contact with another stable object. 
              For example, if a book is resting upon a surface, then the surface is exerting an upward force upon the book in order to support the 
              weight of the book. On occasions, a normal force is exerted horizontally between two objects that are in contact with each other. 
              For instance, if a person leans against a wall, the wall pushes horizontally on the person. 
             </p>
        
          <h class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">Friction Force</h>

            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
 

                
                
                The friction force is the force exerted by a surface as an object moves across it or makes an effort to move across it. 
                There are at least two types of friction force - sliding and static friction. Thought it is not always the case, the friction
                 force often opposes the motion of an object. For example, if a book slides across the surface of a desk, then the desk exerts a
                  friction force in the opposite direction of its motion. Friction results from the two surfaces being pressed together closely,
                   causing intermolecular attractive forces between molecules of different surfaces. As such, friction depends upon the nature of 
                   the two surfaces and upon the degree to which they are pressed together. </p>

        <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">Air Resistance Force</h1>

              <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                  The air resistance is a special type of frictional force that acts upon objects as they travel through 
                  the air. The force of air resistance is often observed to oppose the motion of an object. This force will frequently be neglected 
                  due to its negligible magnitude (and due to the fact that it is mathematically difficult to predict its value). It is most noticeable
                   for objects that travel at high speeds (e.g., a skydiver or a downhill skier) or for objects with large surface areas. 
                </p>

        <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">Tension Force</h1>    
        
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            
            
            The tension force is the force that is transmitted through a string, rope, cable or wire when it is pulled 
            tight by forces acting from opposite ends. The tension force is directed along the length of the wire and pulls equally on the objects 
            on the opposite ends of the wire
        
        
        </p> 


        <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">Spring Force</h1>

      
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            

            The spring force is the force exerted by a compressed or stretched spring upon any object that is attached to it.
             An object that compresses or stretches a spring is always acted upon by a force that restores the object to its rest or equilibrium position.
              For most springs (specifically, for those that are said to obey "Hooke's Law"), the magnitude of the force is directly proportional to the
               amount of stretch or compression of the spring.
