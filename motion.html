        <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">What is Motion?
          
        </h1>
        
        

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          The free movement of a body with respect to time is known as motion. For example-  the fan, the dust falling from the carpet, the water that
           flows from the tap, a ball rolling around, a moving car etc. Even the universe is in continual motion. Are all these motions the same? 
           Is the motion of a pendulum the same as that of a moving car or train? There are various types of motions that are happening around us 
           and they can be basically distinguished on the basis of:

          Time 
          Speed
          Distance
          Path 
            </p>


        <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">4 Types of Motion
          
        </h1>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">

          As per physics and mechanics, there are mainly 4 types of motion, i.e.

          Rotary Motion: A special type of motion in which the object is on rotation around a fixed axis like, a figure skater rotating on an ice rink.
          Oscillatory Motion: A repeating motion in which an object continuously repeats in the same motion again and again like a swing.
          Linear Motion: A one-dimensional motion on a straight line, like an athlete running on a straight track.
          Reciprocating Motions: A repetitive and continuous up and down or back and forth motion like a needle in a sewing machine.

            </p>
        
        
          <h class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">Oscillatory Motion</h>

            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
 
              Oscillatory motion is simply elaborated as the repeated motion that an object does by repeating the same movement again and again. 
              The oscillatory motion would keep on moving forever when there is an absence of friction but in our real world, the motion eventually
               stops by coming to equilibrium.
 
                 </p>


        <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">Rotational Motion</h1>

              <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                Rotational motion can be defined as when an object moves along its axis and all the parts of it move for a different distance in a
                 given period of time. Thus, if an object is under rotational motion all of its parts will move different distances in the same interval
                  of time. 
                </p>


        <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">
          Translational Motion
        </h1>    
        
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            
          When all the parts of an object move the same distance in a given time is known as transitional motion.
           For example, a cycle moving on a track, a man walking on the road, birds flying in the sky.        
        </p> 
       

                <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">Periodic Motion </h1>

                <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">A motion that repeats itself after equal intervals of time is known as periodic motion. 
                  Commonly, the objects under this motion are mostly in the to and fro motion. </p>
       
                  <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">Circular Motion</h1>

                  <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">When an object is constantly moving in circular a path it is called circular motion. 
                    It circular motion, the speed of the object should be constant.
                    Few examples of circular motion are- Movement of the earth on its axis, a bicycle or a car moving on a circular track of park,
                     the motion of the moon around the earth etc.</p>

                     <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">Linear Motion </h1>

                     <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Linear motion can be defined as the movement of a body on a straight line without any deviation. 
                      Important examples of linear motion are: An athlete running on a straight track of a park, a bullet shot from a pistol always moves
                       in a straight line, etc. </p>

                       <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">Uniform Motion </h1>

                       <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">A body is said to be in a state of uniform motion when it covers an equal amount of distance
                          in equal intervals of time. In such cases, if we represent the motion on the graph, it would be a straight line.
                        Common examples of uniform motion are: A car moving on a straight road at a steady speed, a flying aeroplane at a set height 
                        at a constant speed, etc</p>
                        <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">Non-Uniform Motion</h1>

                        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Non-uniform motion can be defined as when a given body is covering unequal distances in a set and 
                          given intervals of time. If you will represent the path of a body moving in non-uniform motion on a graph, it will be a curved line. 
                          Examples of non-uniform motion are- a man walking on the road, a freely falling body, a train moving at various speed limits, etc.</p>
